1.4.0

base64_decode no longer does automatic input string length calculation when passing 0 as length.
Explicit length must be passed to the function at all times.

All string APIs and functions taking string arguments have been extended to take and supply
an explicit length argument/result, in order to avoid extra strlen calls to determine an
already known length.

Path and string functions no longer automagically reallocate passed arguments. Functions
now exist in two flavours, one acting on a passed buffer (best effort) and one allocating
a new buffer.

Build time size limit configuration in build.h have been moved to a run time configuration
block passed to foundation_initialize.

All shutdown functions have been renamed to finalize to better match the initialize function
naming scheme.

system_* functions returning strings now take a buffer argument for thread safety. Returned
string will be in supplied buffer.
