1.4.1

Thread API change. Threads are now explicit structures instead of reference counted
resources. Thread notification changed to a signal state semaphore. Finalizing a
thread will join the thread and free resources.


1.4.0

Major API changes, 1.4.x is not in any way compatible with previous releases.

All string APIs and functions taking string arguments have been extended to take and supply
an explicit length argument/result, in order to avoid extra strlen calls to determine an
already known length. All length arguments are explicit, zero no longer implicitly mean
length of zero-terminated string passed in pointer. Pointer is assumed to be valid if length
is non-zero, no additional null pointer checks are done.

Path and string functions no longer automagically reallocate passed arguments. Functions
now exist in two flavours, one acting on a passed buffer (best effort) and one allocating
a new buffer.

Size of buffers and objects are now denoted by size_t type arguments, not unsigned int.

Functions returning arrays as result now generally take a preallocated array of given size
as argument to avoid extra memory allocations.

Build time size limit configuration in build.h have been moved to a run time configuration
block passed to foundation_initialize.

All shutdown functions have been renamed to finalize to better match the initialize function
naming scheme.

system_* functions returning strings now take a buffer argument for thread safety. Returned
string will be in supplied buffer.
