\brief Apple system header includes
\details Safe inclusion of mach and Apple headers for both OSX and iOS targets. Use this header
instead of direct inclusion of mach/Apple headers to avoid compilation problems with
multiple or missing definitions.

\internal NOTE - The base of all header problems with XCode is that
<code>#include <Foundation/Foundation.h></code> in system headers will actually map
to our foundation/foundation.h \endinternal
