It provides:\r\n\r\n* Abstractions and unification of basic data types\r\n* Pluggable memory management\r\n* Threads and synchronization\r\n* Timing and profiling\r\n* Object lifetime management\r\n* Events processing\r\n* File system access\r\n* Dynamic library loading\r\n* Process spawning\r\n* Logging, error reporting and asserts\r\n* String handling in UTF-8 and UTF-16\r\n* Murmur hasing and statically hashed strings\r\n* Math support for 32 and 64 bit floats\r\n* Configuration repository with config file I/O\r\n* Application environment queries and control\r\n* Crash utilities (SEH, Mach exception handlers, signals)\r\n\r\nIt is written with the following API design principles in mind:\r\n\r\n* Consistent. All functions, parameters and types should follow a well defined pattern in order to make it easy to remember how function names are constructed and how to pass the expected parameters.\r\n* Orthogonal. A function should not have any side effects, and there should be only one way to perform an operation in the system.\r\n* Specialized. A function in an API should perform a single task. Functions should not do completely different unrelated tasks or change behaviour depending on the contents of the variables passed in.\r\n* Compact. The API needs to be compact, meaning the user can use it without using a manual. Note though that \"compact\" does not mean \"small\". A consistent naming scheme makes the API easier to use and remember.\r\n* Contained. Third party dependencies are kept to an absolute minimum and prefer to use primitive or well-defined data types.\r\n  \r\nThe latest source code maintained by Rampant Pixels is always available at\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rampantpixels/foundation_lib\r\n\r\nThis library is put in the public domain; you can redistribute it and/or modify it without any restrictions.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
